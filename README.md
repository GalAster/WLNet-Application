=======================
*Tom's Obvious Minimal Language*

Current support version TOML v0.3

## Theme Compatibility

Highlighting is compatible with all themes, but the visual experience will be affected by the theme.

Main development environment was under [Flatland Monokai](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gerane.Theme-FlatlandMonokai).
